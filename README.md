# HAACHAMA-Locker
 A prank screen-locking program! (For entertainment only; not to be used for illegal purposes).
 This program locks the screen, sets the volume to maximum, and repeats the earrape phrase, "Marco is washed at Counter Strike, VALORANT and League," read by Justin. To exit the program, the text must be clicked slowly 100 times.
